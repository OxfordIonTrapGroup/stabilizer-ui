# stabilizer-ui
A UI for communicating with and visualising live data streamed from stabilizer. This was previously named `l674_lock_ui`.

## Applications:
Install the package via poetry, which will add the following apps to the environment PATH.
* `dual_iir_ui`: For Stabilizers running the `dual_iir` binary. 
* `l674_lock_ui`: ðŸš§ **UNDER REWORK** ðŸš§ For locking the 674 laser in Lab 2, or any Stabilizer running the `l674-lock` binary. Still running on commit [95ff6d1f](https://gitlab.physics.ox.ac.uk/ion-trap/l674-lock-ui/-/commit/95ff6d1fb9750b0fed57aef9e3dfcdccd6cf2bd2) on the 674 PC, but due to breaking changes it might be challenging to replicate its environment.
